    title: "Why I Started Swervy Cares",
    excerpt: "The personal journey that led me to create a platform for empowering young girls through self-care and confidence building.",
    content: `Hi, I'm Aishni Raghuvanshi. I wanted to take a moment to share the story behind Swervy Cares, a project that I have recently dedicated a lot of my time to kick off.

In 2019, right before the world shut down because of COVID, I started making and selling cosmetics. I built a little website, opened social media pages, and slowly started building a small community of customers. I sold handmade lip glosses and lip scrubs that I carefully packaged in fun, creative containers. I was so proud of what I made. It was more than just a hobby, it was something I truly loved.

Over time, Swervy Cosmetics started getting orders from all over the country. I even remember someone making a YouTube video reviewing the products. For three years, I ran my small business with so much passion and joy.

As I got older, I began exploring other interests, especially in AI and machine learning, and I eventually shifted my focus to those new paths. But even though my passions started to change, my love for beauty and self-care never really went away.

At the same time, something kept sticking with me. I realized that not every girl had the chance to experience the little things I was creating, like lip gloss, scrubs, or cute makeup accessories. The things that made me feel good were things some girls didn't have access to at all. These aren't necessities in life, but they do bring joy. They help you feel confident. They're small, but they matter. And for girls who are already facing hard things, not having access to even these small luxuries felt unfair.

That's what inspired me to start Swervy Cares. I wanted to create something that would give these beauty products to girls who might not be able to afford them. More importantly, I wanted these girls to know something they may not hear enough:

üíó You're beautiful. You're worthy. You deserve this.

Swervy Cares isn't just about giving away beauty products. It's about building confidence.

Whether it's through beauty kits, self-care events, or just showing up for the community, my hope is that no girl feels left out because of her situation.

This is only the beginning. I'm so grateful you're here with me.

Thank you for supporting Swervy Cares. Let's keep spreading love: one lip gloss, one care package, one girl at a time.

With love,
Aishni Raghuvanshi`,

    title: "The Science Behind AI-Powered Beauty Recommendations",
    excerpt: "How we use machine learning to understand personal style preferences and create perfectly matched recommendations for each girl.",
    content: `Working on the AI behind Swervy Cares has been one of the most meaningful things I've ever done. Whenever someone asks how our AI chat works, I genuinely love sharing the story and walking them through how carefully we built it.

It all starts with understanding three simple but important things. First, the makeup style each girl feels drawn to. Some prefer natural looks, others love bold styles, and some are all about the latest trends. Second, the colors that make them feel most confident. And third, the scents they personally love, which often connect to memories or emotions.

What makes our AI really special isn't just the technology. It's how we trained it to understand girls in a real, thoughtful way. For example, when a 12-year-old says she likes bold makeup, that can mean something completely different from what a 16-year-old might mean. The system is built to give age-appropriate recommendations every time.

The recommendation engine works with over 30 color choices and more than 16 scent options. But it's not about picking from a big list. It's about finding what truly fits each girl. If someone says she loves warm tones and sweet scents, the AI doesn't just grab random suggestions. It carefully chooses products that make sense based on the whole conversation.

One thing I'm really proud of is that the system remembers the little things. If a girl says she feels confident wearing a certain color to school, that stays in mind. It helps recommend not just the right lip gloss, but maybe also a confidence journal or a motivational sticker that speaks to her personally.

The best part? It's when I see messages from girls who say the AI really understood them. That moment makes everything worth it. It's not magic. It's care, attention, and a lot of heart behind the way we built it.`,
