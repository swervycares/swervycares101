# PART 1: PREPARE YOUR FILES

## Step 1.1: Download Your Project from Replit
1. In your Replit project, look at the **file explorer on the left**
2. At the very top, you should see your project name or a folder icon
3. **Right-click** on the top-level folder
4. Select **"Download as ZIP"**
5. Your browser will download a file called something like `swervy-cares.zip`

**Screenshot Reference**: Look for the file tree that shows folders like `client`, `server`, `shared`

## Step 1.2: Extract the Files
1. **Find the downloaded ZIP file** (usually in your Downloads folder)
2. **Right-click** on the ZIP file
3. Select **"Extract All"** (Windows) or **"Open"** (Mac)
4. Choose where to extract (like your Desktop)
5. **Open the extracted folder** - you should see:
   ```
   â”œâ”€â”€ client/
   â”œâ”€â”€ server/
   â”œâ”€â”€ shared/
   â”œâ”€â”€ netlify/
   â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
   â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
   â”œâ”€â”€ netlify.toml
   â””â”€â”€ many other files
   ```

**Important**: Make sure you can see the `netlify` folder and `netlify.toml` file - these are crucial for the deployment to work.

# PART 2: UPLOAD TO GITHUB

## Step 2.1: Create GitHub Account (Skip if you have one)
1. Go to **github.com**
2. Click **"Sign up"**
3. Create account with your email

5. **Do NOT check** "Add a README file" (we already have one)
6. **Do NOT check** "Add .gitignore" or "Choose a license"
7. Click **"Create repository"**

## Step 2.3: Upload Your Files
1. You'll see a page with setup instructions - **ignore the code commands**
2. Look for the link that says **"uploading an existing file"** - click it
3. **Select all your extracted files**:
   - On Windows: Press `Ctrl + A` in your extracted folder
   - On Mac: Press `Cmd + A` in your extracted folder
4. **Drag all selected files** into the GitHub upload area
5. You should see it uploading many files - this is correct
6. **Scroll down** to the bottom of the page
7. **Commit message**: `Initial commit: Swervy Cares website with AI chat`
8. Click **"Commit changes"**

**Wait for upload to complete** - this may take 2-3 minutes depending on your internet speed.

## Step 2.4: Verify Upload Success
After upload, you should see your files in the repository:
- Folders: `client`, `server`, `shared`, `netlify`
- Files: `package.json`, `README.md`, `netlify.toml`, etc.

If you don't see the `netlify` folder, the deployment won't work - contact me for help.

# ðŸ†˜ TROUBLESHOOTING

**Check**: Build logs in Netlify's "Deploys" tab for specific errors

**Solution**: Verify both `VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY` and `OPENAI_API_KEY` are set with your actual API key

## Site Not Loading

**Solution**: DNS propagation can take time

## Functions Not Working

**Solution**: Re-upload files making sure `netlify` folder is included

## Forms Not Submitting
**Check**: Network tab in browser developer tools for error messages
**Solution**: Usually related to missing environment variables
